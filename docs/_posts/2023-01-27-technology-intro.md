Technology is a topic and a discipline just like _system development_ and _programming_. We will utilize tech and tech stacks to sustain and automate other disciplines, including _collaboration_, _documentation_, _verification_. The technology topic will focus on _infrastructure as code_ well actually _anything as code_.

### Why software Is Eating The World
📚 [Article by Venture Capitalist Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/){: target="_blank"}<br/>
⏳ [20:00]

Marc Andreessen wrote this iconic article for the Wall Street Journal i 2011: "Why Software Is Eating The World". When you read it, remind yourself, that in 2011 the iPone was brand new; iPhone3 it still looked like a bar of soap. Far from everyone owned a smartphone.

### DevOps you Say?...
📚 [DevOps you say? No Problemo - We’re SAFe®!](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devops-you-say-problemo-were-safe-lars-kruse){: target="_blank"}<br/>

A historical perspective - on how we ended up here, a critical view on _scaled agile_ - represented by SAFe and a perspective on what DevOps implies in the life of a developer. By yours truly.

### The formal learning goals for "Technology" at KEA

### Lean Coffee
🔍 Search the internet for terms like ["Lean Coffee Meeting"](https://www.google.com/search?q=lean+coffee+meeting){: target="_blank"}<br/>
⏱️ [20:00]<br/>

Follow some of the links and read about the concept - or watch some ["videos"](https://www.google.com/search?q=lean+coffee+meeting&tbm=vid){: target="_blank"}. Time box this to no more than 20:00 or until you get it.

#  Additional resources

### Accounts on GitHub and Google
🔐 [GitHub sign up](https://github.com/signup?source=login){: target="_blank"}<br/>
🔐 [Google sign up](https://account.google.com/){: target="_blank"}<br/> 
⏳ [5:00]

If you are planning to attend a class with [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakruzz/){: target="_blank"} on KEA you will need accounts on both GitHub and Google. If you already have accounts then your fine - you don't need to set up new ones. You can just use the ones you have.

But if you don't have accounts on these platforms already then please go and sign up - the free tier accounts are fine on both platforms.
