Teachers lecturing their students is old-school. But what's the alternative? Well, at least in theory it's easy to come up with a contemporary alternative: Rather than teaching knowledge, the teacher becomes an instructor who facilitates and sustains the student's learning. No _teaching_, just -learning_. This blog is my take on how this is implemented in practice.

But before I dget to that - I need to take a short detour and do the math.

# Earning your banners - let's do the math
In the context of The _European Credit Transfer System[^ects]_ (ECTS) points are measured relative to _time spent by the student._  In Denmark one point eguals ≈28 hours spent by the student.

[^ects]: The European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) is an obligatory protocol which all Higher Educations in EU/EØS have committed themselves to be compliant with. In this system students earn ECTS points allowing them to freely exchange merits between relevant programmes all across EU/EØS. An ECTS pointpoint is sis essentailly a measure of _time spent by the student_. The Danish Minstry of Higher Education and Science has [enterpreted](https://ufm.dk/uddannelse/anerkendelse-og-dokumentation/dokumentation/ects) how this system works in Denmark. All Higher Educations must adhere to this Danish enterptation. 

When measuring ECTS _time spent_ includes _everything_ relevant to the programme. Examples could be:
- Spending time in class with the instructor
- Reading texts
- Listening to podcasts
- Watching video tutorials or recorded lectures
- Meetings - both <em title="Away From Keyboard">AFK</em> or online
- Writing personal notes, reports, documentation, code, messages in chats, posts in discussion forums, emails.
- Discussing with peers, tutors and instructors
- Team work
- Planning
- Practicing
- Preparing for exam
- Attending examn

A semster is 30 ECTS point so to recieve flying colors you are expected to spend no less than ≈840 hours (≈28x30) per semester - A semester is 20 weeks, so that equals ≈42 hours per week (≈820/20) 

**≈42 hours per week - that's a (busy) full-time job!**

Looking briefly at how the instructors spend _their_ time during a semester, it's a very similar type of calulation, which I won't go into details with just point out that it obviosuly includes:

- Spending time in class with the students
- ...

It shall come as no surprise thay both students and instructors have an activity in which they are in contact with each others - often refered to as _contact time_. 

Students get ≈4 weeks of the semester to prepare and execute examn. The active part of the semester is then about 16 weeks. Finalising the math we can calculate the expected _contact time to other time_ ratio during the active part of the semsester. It is rougly 1:2 - meaning:

**For each hour spent in contact with the instructor - it's expeceted that you spend additional two hours on other stuff**

No more calculations - I promise. But I just wanted to share - or remind - these numbers to you to give you an insight into how I plan my instruction sessions, where I'm expected to dispose over two hours of your time on preparation and practice every time we spend one hour together in class.  

# Flipped classroom
Everything centers around this _contact time_ concept. 

In a traditional old-school approach, teachers would lecture students, as a student you would be expected to spend the time in class, sitting on your but and passively recieve the teacher's knowledge as it would pour over you. You would be expected to suck it up, like a sponge and store and memorise it in your brains. So I could be queried and extracted during an examination.

This approach is now considered old-school and it's not what we (should) practice on KEA. 

In old times universities had the monopoly on both producing and distributing knowledge. If you wanted knowledge you would have to sign up to an education and listen to the professors - pouring knowledge over you.

Today's picture is very different. There is literally no knowledge that I can pour over you in class. That you couldn't just as easily have sucked up yourself from the internet (or even printet books which are frequently still used in higher education).


One established and well renowned practice is _Flipped Classroom_ it's a principle that flips (or shifts left) the traditional divide of what is done where. I've setup up the table to try to clarify:

| Didactic style | Preparation | In class | Practice |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Traditional | **Reading**<br/>(Familiarise yourself with the topic) | **Lecture**<br/>(Be introduced to the topic)  | **Homework**<br/>(Explore the topic) |
| Flipped | **Be introduced to the topic**<br/>(Lecture) | **Explore the topic**<br/>(Homework) | **Familiarise yourself with the topic**<br/>(Reading) |

I'd like to keep this simple. _Flipped Classroom_ is definitely not a revolution, it's a small and simple concept: Watch your lectures online, do your homework at school and add to that later - if you care. The biggest change is not in doing the same thing a bit differently at different locations. But rater what is does to our roles.

An example could be that on the topic of "Flipped Classroom" I would point you to:

- **[Wikipedia on _Flipped Classrrom_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)**<br/> Read the article (≈4600 words ≈ 20:00 reading).
- **[Flipped Classroom Model: Why, How, and Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCIxikOq73Q)**<br/> Watch the video. (≈5:00).
- **[Search for more videos on Flipped Classroom](https://www.google.com/search?q=flipped+classroom&source=lnms&tbm=vid**)**<br/>Browse the results. Pick one or two with length <10:00 from the search results and watch them (or some of them) - make a note of which one yous saw and rank them by your own preference on wether you would recommend them for others interested in understanding Flipped Classroom (timebox this exercise to 30:00 in total) 




**What does _Flipped Classroom_ impose on my role in class - as an _instructor (was teacher)_ and on your role in class - as a _learner (was student)_.**

## The instructor
- Curate and point to (some) material that _learners_ can absorb _before class_ to become introduced to the topic.
- Plan the programme, learning goals and activities.
- Be available for perspectives, opinions, story telling.
- Respond to feed-back and questions.

## The learner
- Focus on problems or challenges; find, design, discuss, think and solve _them_.
- Seek 
- Interact with peers or Community Of Pracice first and instructors later.
- Collaborate 
- Explore what is means to lean - and optimize that process
