Agile work is based on a principle to _Minimize Work In Progress._ The tasks are pulled by the team members rater than _pushed_  by management. Agile teams are _empowered_ and _self-managed_, and requirements are often only high level (user) stories about desireable features - specific on _what_ but not on _how_. We need to get our heads around this - how can this be effective? ...is it even efficient?

# Context
This module is developed in the context of PBA programme for IT Architecture Copenhagen School of Technology and Design (KEA). It's part of the fulfillment of the curriculum of the topic [_Agile Development_](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/4111203/2022-2023){: target="_blank"}.

# The Tech Stack
We will be exploring the following technologies:

- GitHub Projects
- Trello Boards
- MarkDown
- Kanban
- Scrum

# Learning goals
- Understand and master tools and techniques to support agile planning.
- Understand _Kanban Boards_ and _Scrum Boards_ - how they differ and how they match.
- Establish a joint portfolio - of agile stuff!
- Understand _spike_, _timebox_, _kaizen blitz_.

# Prepare for class 

The class is now redefined as a _team_ (not a _class_, not a _group_, not an _organization_ or a _department_ - but a _team_! Something entirely different!).

Now we need _team_ tools - and your preparation before the class is to Sign up and introduce yourself:

Join a Trello _organization_ (their lingo for _team_) and join a GitHub _team_.

We touched briefly on KanBan earlier. The method is old (1980'ies) - it derives from "TPS - Toyota Production System" - Lean Manufacturing. To many it's seen as an alternative method to Scrum. Luckily Kanban is merely a technique and Scrum is (sometimes) a methodology - not (always) a religion - so you are free to combine them if you got the stomach for it.

Watch [Atlassian's take on Kanban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVaFVa7HYj4){: target="_blank"} - and [Miro's explanations of the difference](https://miro.com/blog/scrum-kanban-boards-differences/){: target="_blank"} between KanBan and Scrum.
