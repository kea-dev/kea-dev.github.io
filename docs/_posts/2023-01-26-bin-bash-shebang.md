Teachers lecturing their students is old-school. But what's the alternative? Well, at least in theory it's easy to come up with a contemporary alternative: Rather than teaching knowledge, the teacher becomes an instructor who facilitates and sustains the student's learning. No more _teaching_ from here on it's just _learning_. This blog is about my personal take on how to implement this in practice. A glimpse into what it implies to attend my class.

# The Tool Stack
Let me introduce the tool-stack - At the core is simply:

- GitHub
- Google Docs

We may need more tools later, but they would then be specific to the problems or challenges at hand and we will add them _ad hoc_ as we identify a specific need them. 

Two considerations arise from introducing this new tool-stack:

1. What consequences does this new stack imply to the one that's already officially pointed out by KEA. Most importantly Fronter and  Microsoft 365 including Teams, chats, Word, Excell, Sharepoint, Outlook
2. Should we also use our school accounts when accessing these new tools?

Regarding the first consideration I'll promise to not require any use of Microsoft 365 in my instructions at all and I'll also promise to keep Fronter in the loop. So I'll keep Fronter updated and you can continue to use Fronter as your goto tool when you need to lookup what's the program for the next classroom session? are there any announcements I need to know of? But on Fronter I'll only put in a short proxy or placeholder - pointing you to the real action. Which will be a publicly available post - exactly like the one you are reading now - and then we will take it from there.

To the 2<sup>nd</sup> consideration: Wether or not you should use you school accounts to access GitHub and Google Docs respectively the answer is _"no - setup personal, free accounts and use them"_. This can seem like a bit controversial reply in context of school recommendations and GDPR regulations but I assure you that its not. Individuals are not regulated by GDPR - only organizations providing or enforcing utilization of systems on behalf of individuals are required to be GDPR compliant. Therefore, since the tools I include are accessible from personally managed accounts - not regulated by the school and at no cost to you - I am liberated to include them as a prerequisite for attending my sessions.

This setup gives you - as a learner - a huge advantage, since you will _always_ have access to the stuff we create together - even after you have left KEA - regardless if you graduate or drop-out.

You should consider if you want to join with your existing personal accounts - assuming you already have accounts on both Google and Github - or if you should setup new, maybe additional, accounts for these sessions. My recommendation would be to keep it simple and use the ones you have. You are you. There's no need to impersonate different instances of yourself by having multiple accounts.

# Structure
My leaning sessions will all roughly follow the same structure.

- The off-set (at least for KEA students) will be an entry in Fronter. It will schedule (typically) 2x90min of classroom time at KEA and it will point to:
- A post on [docs.kea.dev](https://docs.kea.dev){: target="_blank"}. It will be a post similar to this post. I will strive to record a reading of the post - and put a link to that in the post itself - so you can choose to either read the post or listen to me reading out aloud.
- The post will also list all the additional resources you must absorb prior to meeting up in class for the schedules session.
- While absorbing all these resources you are encouraged to practice _active reading._ Scribble down everything you want to bring into class; notes, drawings, questions, terms and concepts you don't understand, terms and concepts that inspire you, additional links and resources you investigated, etc. My recommendation is that you make these notes in a format this is prepared for sharing - ideally in MarkDown - store it in either a file, an issue or a post in a discussion on GitHub - or alternatively in a Google Doc.
- Each module also has a dedicated companion repository; Open Source and publicly available on [Kea-Dev at GitHub](https://github.com/kea-dev){: target="_blank"} it will be clearly mentioned in the post on [docs.kea.dev](https://docs.kea.dev){: target="_blank"} which repo to use for the specific module. 
- In the companion repository you may find starter code and activity descriptions - if any is used in the session. You can fork or copy the repository obtain your own repo if required.
- In the companion repo you will also find that the _Discussions_ tab i available and open for everyone with at GitHub account to join. So if you are brave _(I Dare You - Be Brave!)_ you can make the scribbles that you made during your _active readings_  public in the discussion in the companion repo on GitHub. So ask/clarify/reply to others for the world to see. It's funny how intimidating it usually is for most developers (at least in the beginning) to share code, thoughts and questions in public when it comes to professional work. And at the same time not having problems with sharing personal stuff on SoMe platforms. But hey - overcoming that barrier is what makes Open Source a success, so _be brave._



# Learning goals
- Explore and understand the concept of "flipped classroom" through a self-introduction based on absorbing curated content.
- Elaborate on the consequences it imposes on roles and responsibilities of both the _teacher/instructor_ and the _students/learners_.
- Explore the benefits as well as the liabilities of a flipped classroom approach.
- Get a feel for a _contribution centric_ collaboration platform - as opposed to an _assignment or task centric_ collaboration platform.
- Access GitHub with a personal account.
- Access Google Doc with a personal account.
- Learn the most basic MarkDown features.

# Resources
Perform _active reading._ scribble notes, questions, perspectives, links, references, drawings, models etc.

Share your notes, engage in public discussions with fellow learners and instructors. You can take a soft start and read the Q&A session and see if you can ask a question, contribute with a reply to an unanswered one or maybe improve or vote-up some of the answers already given by others.
